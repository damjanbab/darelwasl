Standard session protocol:
- Start services and build the UI when needed.
- Run smoke/verification checks automatically (scripts/checks.sh app-smoke or scripts/app-smoke.js).
- Capture browser console + network errors; save logs into $TERMINAL_LOG_DIR (app-console.log, app-network.log).
- Fail closed on test errors and report exact failures.
- Provide a concise status summary before asking for review.
